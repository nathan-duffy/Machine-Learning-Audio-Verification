## Using Machine Learning to Verify Audo Quality

### Project Outline:

#### Overview:
This project was my final capstone during my undergrad. My partner and I created a machine learning model that verifies audio quality on songs, while also learning how to house this on a website utilizing database management. 

#### 1. Creating the Machine Learning Algorithm
a. Gather Training/Testing Data
<br>b. Labeling Data
<br>c. Feature Engineering
<br>d. Training the Model
<br>e. Revising/Iterating/Testing

#### 2. Creating a Website
a. HTML/CSS
<br>b. Utilizing Flask to run the machine learning model
<br>c. Implementing a database to house our uploaded spectrograms

#### Findings:

To answer the research question we started with, yes it is possible to verify audio quality. 
However, to make this algorithm viable we need much more training data (coming from the website, and most likely another improvement in feature 
engineering. That being said, we did improve the accuracy greatly. Since there are 10 labels, a person guessing would 
have a 10% chance of getting the label right. We started out with having our algorithm is only 3% better than guessing 
to 23% better than guessing (33%). With more data and more feature engineering, this algorithm could be a viable tool for anyone 
who wants to know the true quality of their song.
